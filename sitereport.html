The background gradient maintains consistency with the rest of the site, and responsive design ensures that the content is accessible and readable on all devices.</p>

        <h2>Technologies and Design Choices</h2>
        <p>The website is built using HTML and CSS, with additional JavaScript for responsive navigation. The design choices focus on creating a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. The gradient backgrounds provide a visually appealing aesthetic, while CSS animations add subtle interactions that enhance the user experience.</p>
        <p>Responsive design is a key consideration, ensuring that the website is accessible and functional on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. The use of a hamburger menu for navigation on smaller screens improves usability and ensures that all content remains easily reachable.</p>

        <h2>Reflection and Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>Creating this portfolio website has been a valuable learning experience. It provided an opportunity to apply web development skills and experiment with design principles. One of the main challenges was ensuring that the website remained responsive and performed well across different devices and screen sizes. This required careful planning and testing, particularly for the navigation and layout elements.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, there are several areas for potential improvement. Adding more interactive elements, such as modal popups for project details, could enhance the user experience. Additionally, integrating a content management system (CMS) would make it easier to update and manage the content without needing to modify the HTML directly.</p>
        <p>Overall, this project has been a significant step in developing a professional web presence, and the knowledge gained will be invaluable for future web development endeavors.</p>
